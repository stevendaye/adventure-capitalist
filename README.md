# Adventure Capitalist | Clone of the Adventure Capitalist Game
Adventure Capitalist is an idle business sim-game. The basic idea behind the game is to purchase a business, win capital from that business, upgrade the business and then purchase more businesses.

In order to automate this, you can hire a manager who can run the business for you, so you donâ€™t have to click manually anymore. Then you can upgrade the business and gain even more money.

The version of the game implemented here is a clone of the Adventure Capitalist game. So, this is a basic gameplay with upgrading businesses and hiring managers. The game can be accessed at https://adventure-capitalist.herokuapp.com.

## The Problem
...

## The Solution
...

This solution focuses on Full Stack Developement. This is a fullstack game built around carefully chosen technologies to make scaling easy.

### Main JavaScript Dialect
- ES6+

### JavaScript Stack
- Front End
 - React.js
 - React Router
 - Redux
 - Redux Thunk

- Back End
 - Node.js
 - Express.js
 - Restify.js | To create production ready APIs
 - SQLite3 | To persist the gaming platform's and user's data into a light and portable database
 - Sequelize
 - JSONWebTokens

### Architecture
- Model-View-Controller
- Microservice
 - Users (AuthNet | **Authentication Network** service)
 - Paltfrom (FrontNet | **Front End Network** service)

## Reasons behind technical and architectural choices
- Using **ES6+**, we can lavarage latest and advanced JavaScript features. This helps the code to be more declaritive, readable and maintainaable.
- Seeing the design of the gane and its complexity, I prefer over everything else the **React.js**, **Redux** and **React Router** library. These, allow me build a performant game application, ease my development and workflow using *Reusable and Composable Compoments*, help me manage the *state* efficiently making sure the code is more predictable, help avoid passing down props to deep nested compoments and most importantly help render fast.
